SAENOPY is a free open source 3D traction force microscopy software. Its material model is especially well suited for
tissue-mimicking and typically highly non-linear biopolymer matrices such as collagen, fibrin, or Matrigel. 

It features a python package to use in scripts and an extensive graphical user interface.

Check out our [Documentation](https://saenopy.readthedocs.io) on how to install and use it or our preprint:
